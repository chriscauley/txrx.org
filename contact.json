I am interested in creating a makerspace in my hometown of Fayetteville, AR.  My facebook page uses my full name if you want a verification that I am not a rival enterprise.  My vision of our as-of-yet-non-existent makerspace looks very much like what you have created in TXRX Labs.  \r\n\r\nSeeing as one of the fundamental tenets of the concept is collaboration I am appealing to your sense of duty to fellow - and non-competitive due to geography - makers and am asking for a small amount of your time to answer a few questions regarding the formation and growth of your business and how that can help me wrap my mind around exactly what it is I am doing.  When exploring the idea to start any new venture one is encouraged to seek the wisdom of those who have already succeeded.  You have apparently succeeded so here I am.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of questions/topics I would like to explore with you.  If you would prefer to talk over the phone I would be ecstatic.  Let me know a time and number at which you can be reached if you would prefer that.  I promise not to take any more than 15-20 minutes, unless we really hit it off in which case all bets are off.  \r\n\r\n1.  Membership:   How many members (tool access vs dedicated studio space) do you currently have?  What was the growth like to get to that number i.e. how long did it take to get to where you are?  What sort of month-over-month retention rate do your members display?  \r\n\r\n2.  Facilities/Tools/Services:  What is your current square footage?  Has that number grown since you started?  Did you move or expand existing facilities?  What tools did you provide at launch and how have you grown to include what you now offer?  Can you say with certainty that more interest is shown in woodworking vs metalworking vs electronics vs any other specific 'making' category?  In the beginning did you plan to offer as much as you do now or has the growth been more 'organic' than originally planned?  How do you finance the big equipment acquisitions?  Do you offer any 'consumable' materials to your members or are they required to provide their own materials all the time?  \r\n\r\n3.  Business:  Basically any financial information you are willing to share would be greatly appreciated.  I have a degree in economics but this will be my first startup.  The things I am looking for specifically are: how much of your revenue is based on memberships?  Classes?  Studio rental space?  Other revenue streams (what those might be?)?  What insurance do you carry and what is that expense?  What your monthly utility bill looks like?  Do you advertise?  New membership acquisition costs?  And finally:  How is the ownership and business structured?  Is it a co-op, non-profit, or a privately held, for-profit enterprise?  And, depending on the ownership and management structure, how were you initially financed?  You see, I don't have a lot of (read: nearly zero) money and am stuck on how to structure this thing.  \r\n\r\nThank you thank you thank you for taking the time to read through this.  I hadn't planned on it being so long but I got carried away thinking you were so kind and generous and willing to help out someone as interested in community, collaboration, and economic development as yourselves.  I have tried to drum up as much interest as possible through our local subreddit (r/fayetteville).  Here are the links so you can see where I am:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/fayetteville/comments/2w8mp3/makerspaceworkshop/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/fayetteville/comments/2wy21c/makerspace_meeting/\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for any help you are willing to spare.

I am a close friend of Michelle Haslam. I stopped by TX/RX earlier this week to give MIchelle a ride home and was blown away with what I saw.I also was briefly introduced to Ronald, who gave me a quick tour.  I've been fascinated with the whole maker/hackerspace movement, particularly 3-D printing, ever since I first came across it. I know that Michele had  been doing odd jobs and organizational tasks  for TR/RX before she  had to leave suddenly and return to England. I would really like to take over her duties and would do so passionately. I had dropped off a copy of my resume and a cover letter at TX/RX earlier today, to the attention of Roland Von Kurnatowski. I asked the gentleman who was there at the time for Roland's email address and he suggested I reach out through the Contact form on the website. Please forward this message to Mr. Kurnatowski or the appropriate person. I am available to start as soon as Saturday (tomorrow) and have pasted the cover letter hereto.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\nDoug Desenberg\r\n347-585-0404\r\njddny@mac.com\r\n\r\nText of Cover Letter:\r\nRoland Von Kurnatowski III\r\nExecutive VP\r\nTX/RX Labs\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Roland,\r\nPlease consider me to replace Michelle Haslam in the position she is departing at TX/RX. I am very qualified to do the job. One thing that I feel makes me an especially good fit is that I have been quite fascinated by the maker movement, particularly 3-D printing for quite a long time. This will bring  lot of natural  passion and interest to every task at hand. For example, Michelle mentioned the other day that she had recently been tasked with sitting in on several of the classes offered at TX/RX and developing written course materials. Any such project would be a labour of love for me! I am very flexible as to work schedule, including nights and weekends (even holidays)  and available to start work immediately. \r\n\r\nI read the  interview posted on the TX/RX website about SchoolBot and your pilot program to make 50 SchoolBots and  put  them in local high schools. That is really cool and something I would really love to assist with, both as an employee and on my own time as a volunteer. I recently moved to Houston from New York, but I grew up here, know a lot of wealthy like-minded Houstonians and might be very useful in your fundraising efforts.  I hope to meet you soon.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nDoug Desenberg\r\n347-585-0404\r\njddny@mac.com  \r\n", "from_email": "jddny@mac.com"}}, {"pk": 47, "model": "contact.message", "fields": {"user": null, "subject": 4, "from_name": "alicia", "message": "I don't have a fancy project to work on, just building a computer.

I would like to speak with you about a French robotics enthusiast who will be visiting Houston for a few weeks this summer. I am a coordinator for a summer exchange program, matching international teens with local host families to learn about American culture and practice their English skills. I have a particular young man who has requested to come to Houston this year, and he is a self-described \"science freak\" with a passion for robotics and all things science! Rather than place him with just any family, I thought he might have an amazing experience if placed with a family that has a child with similar interests. I was wondering if you might happen to know of any families who might have be interested in learning more about hosting, or if you would be willing to share the information with the members of your group? \r\n\r\nThis student's name is Robin, he is 15 years old and from France. He needs a host family from June 17 - July 22. This is a short-term commitment, but an amazing cultural experience! Our students speak English, and bring their own spending money and health insurance. Families are asked to provide a bed, meals, and their warm hospitality! Families also are provided with a small weekly stipend to help with costs. \r\n\r\nI would welcome the opportunity to speak with you in greater detail about the program offered by Compass USA. I have coordinated this program for the past 5 years, and I am so excited to meet the new crop of teens each summer! \r\n\r\nAttached is a link to an online flyer with more information about the program, and short summaries of the students. If you could reply with an email address, I can forward Robin's letter he wrote to his prospective host family. He seems like a really great kid, and I am excited to find the perfect family for him!

A specific \r\nsample of interest for collection is a \u2018chip\u2019 sample and is defined as a sample which is forcibly removed or \r\nbroken off from a larger piece of the parent body. \r\nDeveloping a functional prototype tool to break these samples from the asteroid safely while capturing \r\nand containing them for return to Earth is the purpose of this challenge.\r\nObjective \r\nDesign and manufacture a method for an astronaut to break off and contain \u2018chip\u2019 style samples from an \r\nasteroid in microgravity.\r\nRequirements \r\n1. The system shall be capable of containing chips up to approx. 1\u201dx1\u201dx1\u201d\r\n2. The system shall be capable of creating chips less than approx. 1\u201dx1\u201dx1\u201d\r\n3. The system shall capture and retain at least one chip per sample site\r\n4. The system shall provide for collection of samples from 3 separate sites without cross \r\ncontamination between sites\r\n5. The system shall provide for storage of samples independent of one another\r\n6. The system shall prevent chipping debris from impacting the crew member\r\n7. The system shall weigh less than 15 lbs, the lighter the better\r\n8. Powered operations shall be driven manually, pneumatically, and/or hydraulically (with peanut \r\noil)\r\n9. The system shall be ambidextrous\r\n10. The system shall work on rough surfaces that are either; concave, flat, or convex\r\n11. The system shall be compatible with a chlorine water environment\r\n12. The chipping task shall be capable of one-handed operation\r\n13.

Thank you very much for your patience.  Not surprisingly, I have more questions.  \r\n\r\nI would very much like to take the May 15th and 17th Woodworking Tools I class.

I would like to point out that I have taken a similar class at A&M's workshop and was granted lifetime access to their shop.

I understand if it is not possible to add me to the class, but appreciate your willingness to see if the class might have room for me.  \r\n\r\nI would also like to talk to you about donations of materials and equipment.  This is not a bribe!  I have somethings that I could lend to the lab, if there are people who would use them.  Much of it is sewing equipment, but we also have my father in law's workshop, and he was fond of purchasing in duplicate, and keeping things in their packages.  I'm not sure exactly what woodworking tools and supplies I have extras of, but I can take a look sometime soon.  Example sewing items: half legged size 8 dress form with custom sizing pad kit and cover, Bernina 1000 sewing machine, various dressmaker and quilter rulers, tools, and fabrics.  I also have nearly all of the issues of Threads magazine from the 20's to the 130's, and it is a wonderful educational resource for sewing.  \r\n\r\nI am also interested in learning about the available bays and 1/4 bays, as well as any policies regarding children.  My twelve year old son is currently in a robotics class at school and I was hoping that the lab might be a good place for him to work on that and perhaps learn from others since I know next to nothing about robots.  My other son is very creative and interested in computers and I think that exploring electronics or CAD will lead to many interesting creations.
