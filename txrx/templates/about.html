<h3>Our Goals </h3>

Our goals are to bring creative people together, to serve as an incubator for imaginative solutions for everyday problems, to make opaque scientific and technical concepts accessible to everyone through education, and to provide much-needed services to our community, made possible by the skills and passion of our membership.
</li>

<li>
<h3>How to Participate</h3>

Most of our events are open and available to the general public. Access to some of our lab space and tools is limited to our members who have undergone training in the safe use of our lab tools and safety equipment. Information on our upcoming events is available on our calendar.

You can become a member by coming to one of our Open House Fridays and telling one of our officers or directors that you want to be a member.  The membership fee gets you access to tools, collective wisdom, and a racous list-serve!  We have been known to stay late and turn the volume to eleven.  We look forward to welcoming you to Tx/Rx Labs.

<h3>Why TX/RX Labs?</h3>

Imagine how much innovation could occur if the creative community in Houston had access to the tools and knowledge needed to bring its ideas to fruition.  We believe that we must revive the tradition of design and manufacturing in America after decades of neglect and decline.  Many of America's greatest industries began in inspired moments in garage workshops.  We hope to provide you with that workshop through our classes and other educational programs, collective wisdom, and lab space.
