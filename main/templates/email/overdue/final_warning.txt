We are writting because your TXRX Labs membership has been canceled. If you still have any personal items at the lab they will be disposed of soon, so please pick them up now if you haven't. Also remember that non-members are welcome to attend any of our open house nights or other public meetups. We're sorry to see you go and we hope to see you again soon.

Sincerely,
TXRX Labs
