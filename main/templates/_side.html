  <h3 class="block_title">About {{ settings.SITE_NAME }}</h3>
  <p>
    Established in 2008, {{ settings.SITE_NAME }} is a non-profit hackerspace for the greater Houston area.
    Housed in the East End District, we offer courses in and access to our rapid prototyping lab,
    woodshop, machineshop, electronics lab, and a wide variety of other tools. Our goal is to
    educate the public about technology and show how seemingly complex techniques can be used
    by anyone. If you like what we do, please donate.
